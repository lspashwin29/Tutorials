# Tutorials

This is an R Markdown document I created to share some useful tips and tricks I have learned. I have spent some considerable amount of time googling to learn these, so I thought it will be helpful if I can consolidate them at one place and make it easy for others to understand. Let me know if I can improve in any way! Appreciate your feedback.


Some of the tutorials I have included so far are: 

1. gsheetsTutorial: Writing data to googlesheets directly from R. If you are a person who uses R for data manipulation and googlesheets to share your results with others, take a look at this document! It hardly takes 2 minutes!
